#Explain (e.g. via pseudo-code, code and/or text+illustrations) how Lamportâ€™s algorithm
may correct a wrong event ordering.

# Discuss a practical example of the usefulness of Lamport time-stamps
3. Implement the Lamport time-stamp algorithm in Python (use e.g. the Message Passing
Interface) and demonstrate that your implementation can rectify a wrong event ordering
across at least two processes (optional: the processes may reside on different nodes in
a distributed system)
