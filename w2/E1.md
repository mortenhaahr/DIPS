# Discuss a practical example of the usefulness of Lamport time-stamps



Lamport is useful in systems, where there is no requirement for strong clock consistency. 

A useful example could be a logging system, where it is important that the data from a specific sensor is in the correct ordering, but it is irrelevant weather or not all the sensor data from all sensors are logged in the correct order. 



# Implement the Lamport time-stamp algorithm in Python (use e.g. the Message Passing Interface) and demonstrate that your implementation can rectify a wrong event ordering across at least two processes (optional: the processes may reside on different nodes in a distributed system)
