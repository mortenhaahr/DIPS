# Explain (e.g. via pseudo-code, code and/or text+illustrations) how the Vector Clock algorithm may correct a wrong event ordering.



See slide 25.

Example to be determined...





# Discuss and explain what the notion of “strong clock consistency” adds to Vector Clocks over Lamport Timestamps that only satisfy “clock consistency”



The strong consistency adds the notion of concurrent events. This means that events have happened in between two discrete time slots to the local machine.



# Discuss a practical example of the usefulness of Vector Clocks 

Uhhhhhh.... To be determined



# Implement the Vector clock algorithm in Python (use e.g. the Message Passing Interface)
and demonstrate that your implementation can rectify a wrong event ordering across
at least two processes (optional: the processes may reside on different nodes in a dis-
tributed system)
