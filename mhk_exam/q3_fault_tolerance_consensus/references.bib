  abstract = {Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the main causes of cardiac death around the world. Due to its significant impact on the society, early and accurate detection of CAD is essential. This study proposes a novel nested ensemble nu-Support Vector Classification (NE-nu-SVC) model which combines several traditional machine learning methods and ensemble learning techniques for effective diagnosis of CAD. We validated our model using two well-known CAD datasets (Z-Alizadeh Sani and Cleveland). To improve the performance of the model, we selected clinically significant features from the datasets using a genetic search algorithm. To further improve our results, we applied a multi-level filtering technique to balance the data using the ClassBlancer and Resample methods. Our base algorithm, nu-SVC, is performed using four well-known kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial basis (RBF) and sigmoid). The proposed NE-nu-SVC model provided the highest accuracy of 94.66\% and 98.60\% to predict CAD entities in the Z-Alizadeh Sani and Cleveland CAD datasets, respectively. Our system can aid the clinicians to diagnose CAD accurately and may probably replace other invasive diagnostic techniques.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, breast cancer is reported as one of most common cancers amongst women. Early detection of this cancer is an essential to aid in informing subsequent treatments. This study investigates automated breast cancer prediction using machine learning and data mining techniques. We proposed the nested ensemble approach which used the Stacking and Vote (Voting) as the classifiers combination techniques in our ensemble methods for detecting the benign breast tumors from malignant cancers. Each nested ensemble classifier contains ``Classifiers'' and ``MetaClassifiers''. MetaClassifiers can have more than two different classification algorithms. In this research, we developed the two-layer nested ensemble classifiers. In our two-layer nested ensemble classifiers the MetaClassifiers have two or three different classification algorithms. We conducted the experiments on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset and K-fold Cross Validation technique are used for the model evaluation. We compared the proposed two-layer nested ensemble classifiers with single classifiers (i.e., BayesNet and Na\"ive Bayes) in terms of the classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1 measure, ROC and computational times of training single and nested ensemble classifiers. We also compared our best model with previous works reported in the literatures in terms of accuracy. The results demonstrate that the proposed two-layer nested ensemble models outperformance the single classifiers and most of the previous works. Both SV-BayesNet-3-MetaClassifier and SV-Na\"ive Bayes-3-MetaClassifier achieved accuracy 98.07\% (K=10). However, SV-Na\"ive Bayes-3-MetaClassifier is more efficiency as it needs less time to build the model.},

Further, DSS motivation is highest in the presence of high task motivation, more positive DSS performance feedback, and fast DSS response time. The findings have important implications for both DSS research and practice.},

  abstract = {Forest ecosystems are our priceless natural resource and are a key component of the global carbon budget. Forest fires can be a hazard to the viability and sustainable management of forests with consequences for natural and cultural environments, economies, and the life quality of local and regional populations. Thus, the selection of strategies to manage forest fires, while considering both functional and economic efficiency, is of primary importance. The use of decision support systems (DSSs) by managers of forest fires has rapidly increased. This has strengthened capacity to prevent and suppress forest fires while protecting human lives and property. DSSs are a tool that can benefit incident management and decision making and policy, especially for emergencies such as natural disasters. In this study we reviewed state-of-the-art DSSs that use: database management systems and mathematical/economic algorithms for spatial optimization of firefighting forces; forest fire simulators and satellite technology for immediate detection and prediction of evolution of forest fires; GIS platforms that incorporate several tools to manipulate, process and analyze geographic data and develop strategic and operational plans.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed study on the RSS-based location techniques in wireless sensor networks (WSN). There are two aspects in this paper. On the one hand, the accurate RSSI received from nodes is the premise of accurate location. Firstly, the distribution trend of RSSI is analyzed in this experiment and determined the loss model of signal propagation by processing experimental data. Secondly, in order to determine the distance between receiving nodes and sending nodes, Gaussian fitting is used to process specific RSSI at different distance. Moreover, the piecewise linear interpolation is introduced to calculate the distance of any RSSI. On the other hand, firstly, the RSSI vector similarity degree (R-VSD) is used to choose anchor nodes. Secondly, we designed a new localization algorithm which is based on the quadrilateral location unit by using more accurate RSSI and range. Particularly, there are two localization mechanisms in our study. In addition, the generalized inverse is introduced to solve the coordinates of nodes. At last, location error of the new algorithm is about 17.6\% by simulation experiment.},
